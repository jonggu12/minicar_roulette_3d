Oval track model design completed successfully. Created a programmatic Track component using Three.js geometry instead of external 3D modeling software. Implemented an oval track with configurable dimensions (inner/outer radius, track width, height), proper physics barriers (red outer, blue inner), track surface with realistic materials, start/finish line markings, and center lane divider. Track integrated into the Scene with test car-shaped objects for collision testing. Camera repositioned for optimal track viewing.
