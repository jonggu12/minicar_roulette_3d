# Task ID: 8
# Title: Develop Backend API with Next.js
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the backend API using Next.js route handlers or tRPC.
# Details:
Set up a Next.js application with route handlers for API endpoints. Implement basic endpoints for race management and data retrieval.

# Test Strategy:
Test API endpoints using Postman or similar tools to ensure correct responses and error handling.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize Next.js Application [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up a new Next.js application to serve as the foundation for the backend API.
### Details:
Use the Next.js CLI to create a new application. Ensure the environment is set up with Node.js and npm or yarn.

## 2. Configure TypeScript Support [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Add TypeScript support to the Next.js application for type safety and better development experience.
### Details:
Install TypeScript and necessary type definitions. Rename files to .ts or .tsx and configure tsconfig.json.

## 3. Set Up Basic API Route Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Create the basic folder structure for API routes in the Next.js application.
### Details:
Inside the 'pages/api' directory, create subdirectories for different API resources such as 'races' and 'data'.

## 4. Implement Race Management Endpoints [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.3
### Description: Develop API endpoints for managing races, including creation, updating, and deletion.
### Details:
Create route handlers in the 'pages/api/races' directory. Implement POST, PUT, and DELETE methods for race management.

## 5. Implement Data Retrieval Endpoints [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.3
### Description: Develop API endpoints for retrieving race data.
### Details:
Create GET route handlers in the 'pages/api/data' directory to fetch race data.

## 6. Integrate tRPC for Type-Safe API Calls [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2, 8.4, 8.5
### Description: Set up tRPC to enable type-safe API calls within the Next.js application.
### Details:
Install tRPC and configure it in the Next.js application. Define procedures for existing endpoints.

## 7. Implement Authentication Middleware [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.4, 8.5
### Description: Add middleware to handle authentication for API endpoints.
### Details:
Create middleware functions to check authentication tokens and apply them to relevant API routes.

## 8. Set Up Environment Variables [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Configure environment variables for sensitive data and configuration settings.
### Details:
Use a .env file to store environment variables and access them using process.env in the application.

## 9. Implement Error Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.4, 8.5, 8.7
### Description: Add comprehensive error handling to API endpoints to manage and log errors effectively.
### Details:
Use try-catch blocks and error logging libraries to handle and log errors in API routes.

## 10. Deploy Next.js Application [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.6, 8.8, 8.9
### Description: Deploy the Next.js application to a cloud provider for public access.
### Details:
Choose a cloud provider like Vercel or AWS, configure deployment settings, and deploy the application.
