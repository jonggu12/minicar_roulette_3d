# Task ID: 4
# Title: Create Seed Commit/Reveal System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the seed commit/reveal system for fairness verification.
# Details:
Develop a system to generate a SHA256 hash of the seed (serverSalt + entrants + timestamp) before the race. Reveal the original seed after the race for verification purposes.

# Test Strategy:
Verify hash generation and seed reveal process through unit tests and manual verification.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Seed Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the structure of the seed, which includes serverSalt, entrants, and timestamp.
### Details:
Create a data structure to hold the serverSalt, entrants, and timestamp. Ensure that this structure can be easily serialized for hash generation.

## 2. Implement SHA256 Hash Generation [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Develop a function to generate a SHA256 hash from the seed.
### Details:
Use a cryptographic library to implement a function that takes the seed structure, serializes it, and returns a SHA256 hash.

## 3. Store Hash Before Race [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2
### Description: Store the generated hash securely before the race begins.
### Details:
Implement a mechanism to store the hash in a secure and immutable manner, such as in a database or a blockchain.

## 4. Design Seed Reveal Mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Design a mechanism to reveal the original seed after the race.
### Details:
Create a process to securely retrieve and display the original seed to participants for verification purposes.

## 5. Implement Seed Reveal Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.4
### Description: Implement the functionality to reveal the seed after the race.
### Details:
Develop the code to execute the seed reveal process, ensuring it is triggered at the correct time and securely displays the seed.

## 6. Integrate with Race Management System [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.3, 4.5
### Description: Integrate the commit/reveal system with the existing race management system.
### Details:
Ensure that the commit/reveal system is seamlessly integrated with the race management system, triggering hash storage and seed reveal at appropriate times.

## 7. Develop User Interface for Verification [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.5
### Description: Create a user interface to allow participants to verify the seed and hash.
### Details:
Design and implement a UI component that displays the seed and hash, allowing users to verify the fairness of the race.

## 8. Conduct Security Audit [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.6, 4.7
### Description: Perform a security audit of the commit/reveal system to ensure data integrity and security.
### Details:
Review the entire system for potential vulnerabilities, focusing on data storage, hash generation, and seed reveal processes.
